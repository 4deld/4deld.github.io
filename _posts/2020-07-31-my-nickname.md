## POTATO

Today, I'm gonna talk about my nickname, *POTATO*.

The story goes back to 2013.

JunHa Na was my best friend and we learned English at school after school.

JunHa's mom sometimes gave us some snack. The day's snack was potatoes.

I ate potatoes with my head down. Because I've hated dirty things since I was young.

Like this↓

He looked at me and said I eat potatoes like sheep. 

(JunHa's Think) Sheep that eat potatoes. -> *POTATOSHEEP*

Then my nickname became *POTATOSHEEP*

But it was too long. So my friends called me *POTATO*.

This is the story of the birth of the nickname.

On a lighter note, I didn't even know how to write "school" in English at that time.

I asked Junha how to write 'school'. He told me s c h o o l in alphabet. This is so memorable to me.

Maybe I won't forget how to write school even when I'm 80.

Thanks, Junha.


## RLAPO

Next, I'm going to talk about *RLAPO*.

It usually becomes my ID.

I created it by combining my name and nickname.

My Korean name is 김재현 and If I type it on the keyboard, the result is rlawogus.

I added rlawogus and potato, then it became *RLAPO*.


## END

In usual, I get a lot of questions about why my nickname is potato.

I don't answer them because I want people who ask to get to know naturally while they are exploring my GITHUB. (like kind of puzzle ..)

Here's my [GITHUB](https://github.com/rlapo213)!

My English can be awkward. If there’s inconvenience, please send me an email so that I can fix that.
