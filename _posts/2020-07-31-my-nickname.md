Today, I'm gonna talk about my nickname, *POTATO*.

The story goes back to 2013.

JunHa Na was my best friend and we learned English at school after school.

JunHa's mom sometimes gave us some snack. The day's snack was potatoes.

I ate potatoes with my head down. Because I've hated dirty things since I was young.

He looked at me and said I eat potatoes like sheep. 

(JunHa's Think) Sheep that eat potatoes. -> *POTATOSHEEP*

Then my nickname became *POTATOSHEEP*

But it was too long. So my friends called me *POTATO*.

This is the story of the birth of the nickname.

On a lighter note, I didn't even know how to write "school" in English at that time.

I asked Junha how to write 'school'. He told me s c h o o l in alphabet. This is so memorable to me.

Maybe I won't forget how to write school even when I'm 80.

Thanks, Junha.
