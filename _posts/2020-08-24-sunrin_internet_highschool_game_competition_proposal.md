As the title says, I submitted the proposal to Sunrin Internet High School today.

It is about the judging of games developed at in-school competitions.

The two previous development logs, Gangle and Cyto, were projects submitted at in-school competitions.

During the final judging of the two competitions, I was angry twice and had some incomprehensible things. 

I thought a lot during the vacation and tried to submit it before the vacation was over. However I had so many memos and thoughts, and it took time to organize them. so I submitted them on the day the vacation ended.

While I was thinking this made me too tired. It gnawed at my mental strength.

But I decided not to give up. Because if I give up, the judging of the games at in-school competition will remain the same until the world is destroyed.

I've wrote it rationally and I'm not afraid at all, so I'll post here.

Proposals for judging games at in-school competition

Hello, I'm Kim Jae Hyun, a sophomore at Sunrin Internet High School. I have participated in 4 school development competitions so far. Among them, I participated in two competitions by developing games, the 2019 Digital Contents Competition and the 2020 Mobile Contents Competition.

I think the way the final judging of those is wrong. It lasted about 10 minutes, including a presentation and a Q&A session. After the presentation, the judges asked questions during the Q&A session. The content of it was something that I could think that the judges first encountered our game during our team's presentation.
