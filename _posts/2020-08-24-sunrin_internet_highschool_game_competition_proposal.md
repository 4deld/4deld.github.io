As the title says, I submitted the proposal to `Sunrin Internet High School` today.

It is about the judging of games developed at in-school competitions.

The two previous development logs, `Gangle` and `Cyto`, were projects submitted at in-school competitions.

During the final judging of the two competitions, I had some incomprehensible things. 

I thought a lot during the `vacation` and tried to submit it before the vacation was over. However I had many `memos and thoughts` and it took time to organize them. Thus I got to submit them on the day the vacation ended.

While I was thinking this made me too tired. It gnawed at my `mental strength`.

Nevertheless I decided not to give up. Because if I give up, the judging of the games at in-school competitions will remain the same until the world is destroyed.

I wrote it `rationally` and I'm not afraid at all. Accordingly, I'll post here.


## Proposals for judging games at in-school competition

***

Hello, I'm JaeHyun Kim, a sophomore at Sunrin Internet High School. I have participated in 4 school development competitions so far. Among them, I participated in two competitions `by developing games`, the 2019 Digital Contents Competition and the 2020 Mobile Contents Competition.

I think `the way` the final judging is judged is wrong. It lasted about 10 minutes, including a presentation and a Q&A session. After the presentation, the judges asked questions during the Q&A session. The content of them was something that I could think that the judges first encountered our game during our team's presentation.

I don't think it's right that some of the judges judge after `only 10 minutes` of contacting the game. The reason is that judges will have difficulty understanding the four main elements of the game during the judging time. Therefore, they won't be able to understand and judge the game *correctly*. 

As stated earlier, some of the judges understand the game **during the presentation**. So I think it's difficult to be asked based on a deep understanding of the game. As it is the final judging, I hope they would stop asking questions that discuss the game `without trying it themselves` and that are `necessary to understand the game`, such as the procedure of the game or how to manipulate the game. I hope they would ask questions after they totally understand the game. Accordingly, I request as follows.

First, make not only external judges but also school judges at least know how to manipulate the game and how it flows before entering the judging process.

Second, when the judges ask questions about the game, Let the premise "I have played the game." be established.

Thank you for reading it out.

As I wrote above, there were so many memos and thoughts that it took me a long time to distinguish whether I could write them in my proposal or use as supporting factors for my opinions. I think I was able to finish writing because a teacher said it is right to express the wrong thing when I excluded emotions and thought rationally.

My English might be awkward. If you have any inconvenience, please send me an email so that I can correct it.
