I'm sorry that I came so late..

## My school life

Because of the COVID-19, I was so busy.

Seniors go to school every week, but sophomores and freshmen go to school every other week.

So I am very tired in the week I have to go to school.

The break time for each class has been reduced to five minutes.

But our teachers always have many things to teach.

They often exceed class hours *(except few nice teachers)*.

Then we don't have time to rest and prepare for the next class.

Also there are performance assessments at all times when I go to school.

It's impossible to live a leisurely life.

I pursue relaxing and comfortable life. T.T

## About a month ago

The midterm exam was over.

I was shocked by my score.

I had played League Of Legends for five years. I thought it was time to stop. I stopped playing League Of Legends.

I planned IWOP classes (My School Club) for freshmen and developed Cyto Server (Mobile App Development Competition Work) for two weeks right away.

After that, The final exam was only two weeks away.

I studied really hard. I almost went **CRAZY**.

## Future plans

In fact, I wasn't supposed to write a post.

Because I developed the Cyto Server too dirty.

I was going to make it again. But the time given was so short that my colleague said that he don't think I can do that.

***I'm going to post a lot!!***
