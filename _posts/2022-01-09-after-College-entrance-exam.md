**I AM SO SORRY I HAD NOT POSTED**



## 2021 LIFE

Late 2020, I decided to prepare for *THE KOREAN SAT*

There're a lot of reasons. 

First, In 2nd grade, 2nd semester, I was second in Software. maybe (2/75) So, I thought I could do everything I wanted. I had conceit.

Second, My cousin who is still working at Naver had said that except Seoul, Korea, Yonsei and some Flagship National UNIV, they don't even read the application.

Third, Around that time, I was tired of studying School work. It's hard to get good grades in our school. My friends who studied in general high school think that Specialized high school's exams are easy. But! It is not true. Students study very hard. For example, I got 2nd grade though I solved all the problems in exams.  

Fourth, I wanted to see if I would get great grades or not because everyone said no about taking *THE KOREAN SAT*. I tend to act the other way(people say Reactance)

## About *THE KOREAN SAT*

As time goes by, I recognized that I'd all fucked up cause the mock test results were not very good. But I tried not to be frustrated. I believed that everything would go well if I worked hard. When I looked back later, I didn't want to regret not studying. There were no rest time. Only time to study. 

**SHIT HAPPENED** Life is not easy. Working hard doesn't mean everything works. I should've done excellent.
