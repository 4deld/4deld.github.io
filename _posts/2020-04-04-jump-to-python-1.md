I learned Python when I was in middle school. 
But I can hardly remember what I learned. 
So, I'll learn from the beginning again.

I'm sorry that I'll post only Grammar of Python. 

If you wonder how to install and start Python, click this [link](https://wikidocs.net/8) (Korean)

# Python Basic Grammar

If Python is installed Python with that link, you can start Python by clicking `the Window button` and running `IDLE`.

## Four arithmetic operations


## Plus

```python
>>>3+4
7
```

## Minus

```python
>>>3-4
-1
```

## Divide

```python
>>>3/4
0.75
```

## Multiply

```python
>>>3*4
12
```

## Variable

Python is called `an interpreted language` because it goes through an interpreter, which turns code you write into the language understood by your computer's processor. Therefore, Python variables' `data types` are assigned while being interpreted.

```python
>>>a=1
>>>a+3
4
```

## Print

Python distinguishes `upper and lowercase letters`.

```python
>>>a=3
>>>A=7
>>>a+A
10
```


a
