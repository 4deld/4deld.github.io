I learned Python when I was in middle school. 
But I can hardly remember what I learned. 
So, I'll learn from the beginning again.

I'm sorry that I'll post only Grammar of Python. 

If you wonder how to install and start Python, click this [link](https://wikidocs.net/8) (Korean)

`"Life is too short, You need Python!"`




# Python Basic Grammar

If Python is installed Python with that link, you can start Python by clicking `the Window button` and running `IDLE`.

## Four arithmetic operations


## Plus

```python
>>>3+4
7
```

## Minus

```python
>>>3-4
-1
```

## Divide

```python
>>>3/4
0.75
```

## Multiply

```python
>>>3*4
12
```

## Variable

Python is called an `interpreted language` because it goes through an interpreter, which turns code you write into the language understood by your computer's processor. Therefore, Python variables' `data types` are assigned while being interpreted.

```python
>>>a=1
>>>a+3
4
```

## Print

```python
>>>a=1
>>>print(a)
1
```

## Comments

Single line comment

#

```python
>>># Crosshatch is used as a single line comment
```

Multiline comments

'''
'''

```python
'''
triple-quotation mark is used as multiline comment
'''
```

## Case sensitive

Python distinguishes `uppercase and lowercase letters`.

```python
>>>a=3
>>>A=7
>>>a+A
10
```

## indentation

Python does not use braces, unlike C, Java and JS. Instead, It uses indentation. It's okay if you don't understand the code below. We'll learn about that later.

```python
>>>a=2
>>>if a > 1 :
       print(a)
       
2
```       

The indentation can be used by clicking `tab key` or clicking `space bar` four times.
If you miss `the indentation`, Python will print out an `error message` or `unintended result`.
