## Why I joined the Alom club

After I failed to pass the military service interview working on software development in Korea, I admitted that I had not developed software at least for a year because I had to study for the `transfer exam`. During the interview, I was asked if I've never developed `an app`. I was embarrassed, but it was true. I've never developed an app, so I decided to learn `Spring framework`. Around that time, an acquaintance of mine was recruiting club members, and I joined.

## About the club

It has about `300 members` and offers many courses such as C programming and Swift. I hope I can learn Spring framework very well and complete a cool project. Actually, I've been designing a project with my friend.

My English might be awkward. If you have any inconvenience, please send me an email so that I can correct it.
