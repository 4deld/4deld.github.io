## What I learned from two references

I learned important things from two references before the java racingcar project.

[`Strategy pattern`](https://inpa.tistory.com/entry/GOF-%F0%9F%92%A0-%EC%A0%84%EB%9E%B5Strategy-%ED%8C%A8%ED%84%B4-%EC%A0%9C%EB%8C%80%EB%A1%9C-%EB%B0%B0%EC%9B%8C%EB%B3%B4%EC%9E%90)

I couldn't understand all the contents of the post, but I learned one thing. An object can be expressed not only as an object/living thing, but also as a `function, action, or movement`. This makes it easy to maintain.

[`MVC pattern`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogaXW6KPc8I)

How to write codes while keeping the MVC pattern

 - Rule 1: Model should not depend on Controller and View. (There should not be code related to Controller and View inside Model.)

 - Rule 2: View should only depend on Model, not Controller. (There should only be code related to Model and no code related to Controller inside View.)

 - Rule 3: The data that View receives from Model should be data that should be displayed differently for each user.

  - Rule 4: Controller can depend on Model and View. (There can be code related to Model and View inside Controller.)

 - Rule 5: When View receives data from Model, it must receive data from Model through Controller.
