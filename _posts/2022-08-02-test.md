hi 

It's been a long time since I last wrote.

I'm doing well, I am satisfied with my life, of course of in case of college, Korean SAT.

I'm upset about my life. It is so boring and I'm tired of everyday life. I want something fun, interesting! 

I am on a university vacation, so these days I started studying PS again after studying in 2019-2020.

My routine is to wake up in the morning(actually lunch time), eat breakfast while reading a newspaper, sit on the chair in front of the computer until go to bed. PS LOL PS LOL infinitely repeat. 

dizzy 

boring 

flat 

dull

this is what I solved today. very fun and interesting!
