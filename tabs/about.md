## Introduction

Hi, I am a sophomore of **Sunrin Internet High School**.

I'm Korean, living in Seoul.

The reason why my blog is in English is because I reckon English is very significant for programmers. 

I want to study English hard.

So, I'll try to write my posts in English.

I like problem solving, web programming, and swimming.

## My plan

I will post my Development logs, Python Grammar, solving algorithm problems.

I hope you learn anything when you come into my blog, not just going back.


## Development log

I swear Development logs are quite important. 

Because they shows what you've done, what you've felt, etc.

It'll be a good weapon in many ways.

So, I will write the Development log when I do a project, an assignment, a thing that I feel valuable.


***Development log***
 - **The Date**
 - **Title(What is it)**
 - **Description(Give your future self a break, help them remember)**
 - **Tech Stack**
 - **What you were in charge of**
 - **What was the problem(How was it solved? or unsolved?)**
 - **Feelings(what you felt)**
 - **Desired things & Future plans**


Don't be pressured to fit the table of contents.

If the table of contents are in Development log, that'll be all.
